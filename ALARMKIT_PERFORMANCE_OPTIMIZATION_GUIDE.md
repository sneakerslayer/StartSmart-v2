## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Caching Strategy

#### Configuration Caching
```swift
// Check cache first before creating new configuration
if let cachedConfig = alarmConfigurationCache[alarmId] {
    // Use cached configuration (fast path)
    try await scheduleWithCachedConfiguration(alarm, cachedConfig)
} else {
    // Create and cache new configuration
    let config = try await createOptimizedAlarmConfiguration(for: alarm)
    alarmConfigurationCache[alarmId] = config
    try await scheduleWithCachedConfiguration(alarm, config)
}
```

#### Cache Management
- **Size Limits**: Maximum 100 cached configurations
- **Eviction Policy**: FIFO for simple implementation, LRU for production
- **Memory Pressure**: Automatic cleanup on memory warnings
- **Expiration**: Time-based expiration for alarm list cache

### 2. Batch Operations

#### Batch Processing
```swift
// Process multiple alarms efficiently
func scheduleAlarmBatch(_ alarms: [StartSmart.Alarm]) async throws {
    // Add to batch queue
    for alarm in alarms {
        batchOperationQueue.append(.schedule(alarm))
    }
    
    // Process batch immediately for small batches
    if alarms.count <= 5 {
        await processBatchOperations()
    }
}
```

#### Batch Benefits
- **Reduced API Calls**: Process multiple operations together
- **Improved Throughput**: Handle up to 10 operations per batch
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of system resources

### 3. Background Processing

#### Heavy Operations
```swift
// Use background queue for heavy configuration creation
return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
    backgroundQueue.async {
        do {
            let config = try self.buildAlarmConfiguration(for: alarm)
            continuation.resume(returning: config)
        } catch {
            continuation.resume(throwing: error)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Background Benefits
- **Non-blocking UI**: Heavy operations don't freeze the interface
- **Better User Experience**: Smooth interactions during processing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal use of available CPU cores

### 4. Debounced Operations

#### Intelligent Refresh
```swift
// Use debouncer to prevent excessive API calls
refreshDebouncer = Debouncer(delay: 0.5) { [weak self] in
    Task { @MainActor in
        await self?.performDebouncedRefresh()
    }
}
```

#### Debouncing Benefits
- **Reduced API Load**: Prevents rapid-fire API calls
- **Battery Savings**: Fewer network operations
- **Better Performance**: Smoother user experience

## Performance Metrics and Monitoring

### 1. Operation Tracking

#### Performance Metrics
- **Authorization Time**: Time to request AlarmKit permissions
- **Scheduling Time**: Time to schedule individual alarms
- **Batch Processing Time**: Time to process batch operations
- **Refresh Time**: Time to refresh alarm list from AlarmKit

#### Metrics Collection
```swift
func recordSchedulingTime(_ time: TimeInterval) {
    schedulingTimes.append(time)
    if schedulingTimes.count > 100 { schedulingTimes.removeFirst() }
}
```

### 2. Memory Monitoring

#### Memory Usage Tracking
- **Current Memory**: Real-time memory consumption
- **Peak Memory**: Highest memory usage recorded
- **Memory Delta**: Memory change during operations
- **Memory Warnings**: Automatic cleanup on memory pressure

#### Memory Management
```swift
private func handleMemoryPressure() async {
    logger.warning("⚠️ Memory pressure detected, clearing cache")
    
    // Clear all caches except critical ones
    alarmConfigurationCache.removeAll()
    alarmPresentationCache.removeAll()
    alarmScheduleCache.removeAll()
}
```

### 3. Battery Optimization

#### Battery Awareness
- **Battery Level Monitoring**: Track battery percentage
- **Battery State Detection**: Charging, unplugged, etc.
- **Low Battery Warnings**: Alerts when battery is low
- **Battery-aware Features**: Reduce processing when battery is low

#### Battery Optimization
```swift
if batteryLevel < batteryWarningThreshold && batteryLevel > 0 {
    logger.warning("⚠️ Low battery level detected: \(String(format: "%.1f", batteryLevel * 100))%")
}
```
