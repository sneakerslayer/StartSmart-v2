# How to Add PremiumLandingPageV2.swift to Xcode Project

## The Problem
The file exists on disk but isn't added to the Xcode project yet, so the preview doesn't work.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Add via Xcode GUI (Recommended)

1. **Open Xcode** (should already be open if you just tried the preview)

2. **In Xcode, right-click on the "Onboarding" folder** in the file navigator
   - Location: `StartSmart` → `Views` → `Onboarding`

3. **Select "Add Files to 'StartSmart'..."**

4. **Navigate to**: `StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`

5. **Check these boxes**:
   - ✅ "Copy items if needed" (should be unchecked since file is already in right place)
   - ✅ "Add to targets: StartSmart"

6. **Click "Add"**

7. **Try preview again**: `Cmd+Opt+P`

---

### Option 2: Drag & Drop (Faster)

1. **In Finder**, navigate to: `StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/`
   - Or use: `open StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/`

2. **Find**: `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`

3. **Drag it** into Xcode's file navigator onto the "Onboarding" folder

4. **In the dialog that appears**:
   - ✅ Check "Add to targets: StartSmart"

5. **Try preview**: `Cmd+Opt+P`

---

### Option 3: Use Terminal (Command Line)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
cd /Users/robertkovac/StartSmart-v2
# This will be handled by the package manager or Xcode project settings
# Manual addition via Xcode is easier
```

Then open Xcode and verify the file appears in the project.

## After Adding the File

1. **Verify it's in the project**:
   - Check that `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift` appears in the file navigator
   - It should be alphabetically sorted with other onboarding files

2. **Try the preview again**:
   - Open the file
   - Press `Cmd+Opt+P`
   - You should see the preview!

3. **If preview still doesn't show**:
   - Click the "Resume" button in the preview panel (if paused)
   - Or press `Cmd+Opt+P` again to force refresh

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Preview is paused"
- Click the "Resume" button
- Or press `Cmd+Opt+P` to toggle

### "Cannot preview in this file"
- Make sure you're on the file with `#Preview { PremiumLandingPageV2() }`
- Check that the file compiled successfully (no red errors)
- Try cleaning build folder: `Cmd+Shift+K`, then `Cmd+B`

### File still not showing in project
- Close and reopen Xcode
- Or manually add via right-click → "Add Files to 'StartSmart'..."

## Quick Verification

To check if it's now in the project, look for this in the file navigator:

```
StartSmart/
└── Views/
    └── Onboarding/
        ├── AccountCreationView.swift
        ├── DemoGenerationView.swift
        ├── EnhancedWelcomeView.swift (old)
        ├── MotivationSelectionView.swift
        ├── OnboardingFlowView.swift
        ├── PermissionPrimingView.swift
        ├── PremiumLandingPageV2.swift ← NEW! (should appear here)
        ├── ToneSelectionView.swift
        └── VoiceSelectionView.swift
```

---

## Once Added

The preview should work immediately:
1. Open `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
2. Press `Cmd+Opt+P`
3. See your beautiful new landing page! ✨
