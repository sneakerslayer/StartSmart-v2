## Key Findings

### No Breaking Changes
‚úÖ All existing authentication methods are untouched  
‚úÖ Firebase integration unchanged  
‚úÖ User profile creation unchanged  
‚úÖ State management compatible  

### Proper Isolation
‚úÖ Guest mode is additive feature, not replacement  
‚úÖ Sign-in flows don't reference guest mode  
‚úÖ Guest mode doesn't interfere with auth state  

### Regression Risk
‚úÖ **LOW** - Code changes are isolated  
‚úÖ **NO** modifications to core sign-in logic  
‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - All methods present and functional
