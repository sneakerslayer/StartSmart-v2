## Pro Tips:
- **Clean state**: Hide keyboard, ensure no loading spinners
- **Good data**: Use realistic content (not "test test test")
- **Nice time**: Set simulator to morning time (6:30 AM) for authenticity
- **Check streaks**: If possible, show a 7-day streak with progress

I'll create text overlay versions following your Screenshot Storyboard:
- Deep navy background overlays (#0B1026)
- White headlines (60pt SF Pro Bold)
- Subheadings (32pt, 85% opacity)
- Left-aligned with 10% margins
