## Current Status

**Your simulator is ready!** The iPhone 16 Pro Max is running with StartSmart loaded.

### Next Steps:

1. **Bring simulator to front** - Click on the Simulator window
2. **Navigate through the app** following the sequence above
3. **For each screen, tell me when you're ready** and I'll capture the screenshot using the command line

OR

4. **Manually capture** using `âŒ˜S` in Simulator and tell me the filenames so I can organize them

---

## Screenshot Organization

Once captured, I'll:
1. Move all screenshots to `/Users/robertkovac/StartSmart-v2/app_store_screenshots/`
2. Rename them properly:
   - `01_hero_welcome.png`
   - `02_alarm_form_intent_tone.png`
   - `03_voice_selection.png`
   - `04_alarm_active_fullscreen.png`
   - `05_home_streaks_analytics.png`
   - `06_paywall_subscription.png`
3. Verify dimensions (should be 1290 x 2796 pixels for 6.7" iPhone)
4. Create text overlay versions following the Screenshot Storyboard

---

## Tips for Best Screenshots

1. **Use realistic data**: Fill forms with real-looking content
2. **Show active states**: Buttons highlighted, content loaded
3. **Set nice time**: Maybe change simulator time to something like 6:30 AM for alarm
4. **Good streaks**: If possible, show 7-day streak with progress
5. **Clean UI**: Make sure no error states or loading spinners unless intentional

Let me know when you're ready to capture each screenshot!
