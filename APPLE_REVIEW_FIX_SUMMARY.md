## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed (Automated)

### 1. **Guideline 4.0 (Design) - iPad Layout Issues**  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: iPad layout was broken and cut off, especially Terms of Service links

**Solution**:

**Result**: App now only runs on iPhone, no iPad layout issues possible

### 2. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Legal) - Mandatory Account Registration**  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: App required users to create account before accessing free features

**Solution**:

- Guest users can create alarms and access free features without authentication
- Guest mode auto-completes onboarding via UserDefaults

**Result**: Users can now use the app without creating an account

**User Journey**:
1. User taps "Continue as Guest" on onboarding
2. `authService.enableGuestMode()` is called
3. Onboarding marked as complete automatically
4. User can create alarms and access free features
5. Premium features show paywall when needed

### 3. **Guideline 3.1.2 (Business) - Missing Privacy/Terms Links**

### 4. **Guideline 2.1 (Performance) - iPad Sign-In Errors**
