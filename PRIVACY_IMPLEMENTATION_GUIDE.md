## üì± In-App Implementation

### 1. Settings Screen Privacy Section

Add to `SettingsView.swift`:

```swift
Section("Privacy & Legal") {
    Link(destination: URL(string: "https://startsmart.app/privacy")!) {
        HStack {
            Label("Privacy Policy", systemImage: "hand.raised.fill")
            Spacer()
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.right.square")
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        }
    }
    
    Link(destination: URL(string: "https://startsmart.app/terms")!) {
        HStack {
            Label("Terms of Service", systemImage: "doc.text.fill")
            Spacer()
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.right.square")
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        }
    }
    
    NavigationLink(destination: PrivacyControlsView()) {
        Label("Privacy Controls", systemImage: "shield.fill")
    }
    
    NavigationLink(destination: DataManagementView()) {
        Label("My Data", systemImage: "folder.fill")
    }
}
```

### 2. Privacy Controls Screen

Create `PrivacyControlsView.swift`:

```swift
struct PrivacyControlsView: View {
    @AppStorage("analytics_enabled") private var analyticsEnabled = true
    @AppStorage("social_sharing_enabled") private var socialSharingEnabled = true
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Section(header: Text("Data Collection"),
                    footer: Text("Control what data we collect and how it's used")) {
                Toggle("Usage Analytics", isOn: $analyticsEnabled)
                Toggle("Social Sharing Features", isOn: $socialSharingEnabled)
            }
            
            Section(header: Text("Communication")) {
                Toggle("Marketing Emails", isOn: .constant(false))
                Toggle("Product Updates", isOn: .constant(true))
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Privacy Controls")
    }
}
```

### 3. Data Management Screen

Create `DataManagementView.swift`:

```swift
struct DataManagementView: View {
    @State private var showingExportSheet = false
    @State private var showingDeleteAlert = false
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Section(header: Text("Your Data")) {
                Button(action: { showingExportSheet = true }) {
                    Label("Export My Data", systemImage: "square.and.arrow.down")
                }
                
                Button(action: { /* View data */ }) {
                    Label("View My Data", systemImage: "eye")
                }
            }
            
            Section(header: Text("Data Management"),
                    footer: Text("Permanently delete your account and all data. This cannot be undone.")) {
                Button(role: .destructive, action: { showingDeleteAlert = true }) {
                    Label("Delete My Account", systemImage: "trash")
                }
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle("My Data")
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingExportSheet) {
            DataExportView()
        }
        .alert("Delete Account", isPresented: $showingDeleteAlert) {
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
            Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                // Handle account deletion
            }
        } message: {
            Text("Are you sure? This will permanently delete your account and all data.")
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Onboarding Privacy Consent

Update `OnboardingFlowView.swift`:

```swift
// Add to final onboarding step
VStack(spacing: 12) {
    Text("By continuing, you agree to our")
        .font(.caption)
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
    
    HStack(spacing: 4) {
        Link("Terms of Service", destination: URL(string: "https://startsmart.app/terms")!)
        Text("and")
        Link("Privacy Policy", destination: URL(string: "https://startsmart.app/privacy")!)
    }
    .font(.caption)
}
```

## ‚ùì FAQ for Implementation

**Q: Do I need a lawyer?**
A: Yes, we strongly recommend legal review before publishing, especially for GDPR/CCPA compliance.

**Q: Where should I host the privacy policy?**
A: Your own domain is best (https://startsmart.app/privacy). GitHub Pages or Netlify work for MVP.

**Q: How often should I update it?**
A: Review every 6 months, update when practices change, and whenever laws change.

**Q: What about Terms of Service?**
A: You'll also need Terms of Service (see TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md template provided).

**Q: Do I need a DPO?**
A: Only if you process significant EU data. For MVP, a privacy email is sufficient.

**Q: What about children under 16?**
A: Current policy requires 16+. For under-13, you'd need full COPPA compliance (parental consent, etc.).
