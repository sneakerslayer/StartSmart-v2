# Final Instructions to See Your New Landing Page

## The Situation
✅ The file exists: `StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
⚠️ It needs to be added to the Xcode project (2 minutes)

## Easiest Solution

### In Xcode:

1. **Close the project if it's open**

2. **Find ANY onboarding file** in your project:
   - Look for `EnhancedWelcomeView.swift`
   - Or `AccountCreationView.swift`
   - Or `OnboardingFlowView.swift`
   - They might be under "Models" folder or any other folder

3. **Right-click on that file** → "Show in Finder"

4. **In Finder**, you should now see the Onboarding folder

5. **Find `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`** in that folder

6. **Drag `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`** back into Xcode project navigator
   - Drop it near the other onboarding files
   - IMPORTANT: Check "Add to targets: StartSmart" when the dialog appears
   - Click "Finish"

7. **Now you can**:
   - Press `Cmd+Opt+P` to see preview
   - Or just run the app on simulator - the new landing page will show!

## Alternative: Open Directly in Xcode

Since ContentView.swift is already modified to show PremiumLandingPageV2():

1. In Xcode: **File → Open** → Navigate to `StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/`
2. Select `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
3. Xcode will ask: "Would you like to add this file to the StartSmart project?"
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Now it will compile and work!

## After Adding File

The app is already set to show your new landing page!
Just run it (Cmd+R) and you'll see the beautiful new design.

**Note**: I already modified ContentView.swift to show `PremiumLandingPageV2()` instead of `OnboardingFlowView()`.
Once you add the file to Xcode, it will work!
