# Quick Fix: Finding Your Onboarding Files

## The Issue
The Onboarding folder exists on disk but isn't showing in Xcode's file navigator. The onboarding files ARE in the project, they're just grouped under "Models" (older Xcode projects sometimes do this).

## Quick Solution

### In Xcode, look under "Models" folder
Expand the "Models" folder - you should see:

- OnboardingState.swift
- OnboardingFlowView.swift
- EnhancedWelcomeView.swift  
- MotivationSelectionView.swift
- ToneSelectionView.swift
- VoiceSelectionView.swift

### Two Ways to Add the New File:

#### Option A: Find any onboarding file and add nearby
1. In Xcode, locate any onboarding file (like `EnhancedWelcomeView.swift`)
2. Right-click on it
3. Select "New File..." 
4. Choose "Swift File"
5. Name it: `PremiumLandingPageV2`
6. **But wait!** Since the file already exists, just:
   - Right-click on an existing onboarding file
   - Select "Add Files to 'StartSmart'..."
   - Navigate to: `StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
   - Make sure "Add to targets: StartSmart" is checked
   - Click "Add"

#### Option B: Easiest - Just open it
The file already exists! Just open it in Xcode:
1. In Xcode menu: **File â†’ Open...**
2. Navigate to: `/Users/robertkovac/StartSmart-v2/StartSmart/Views/Onboarding/`
3. Select: `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
4. Click "Open"
5. Press `Cmd+Opt+P` to preview!

## Verify It's Added
After opening, check if it appears in the project navigator. If it does, you're all set! If not, we can add it to the project manually.

## Next Steps
Once the file is visible in Xcode:
1. Open `PremiumLandingPageV2.swift`
2. Press `Cmd+Opt+P` 
3. See the preview!
