OPTIONAL: SIGN-IN TESTING

If you want to test account features:

Free tier works with or without sign-in.

- Premium voice personas
- Advanced analytics

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

Simulator:
- Custom notification sounds may not play (iOS simulator limitation)
- Use default system sound as fallback
- Physical device recommended for full notification testing

Network Required:
- AI content generation requires internet connection
- Text-to-speech synthesis requires API access
- Offline mode shows cached content

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

Architecture:
- SwiftUI + MVVM pattern

SUBSCRIPTION TESTING:

- Restore purchases functionality available

NOTIFICATION PERMISSIONS:

The app requests notification permissions during onboarding:

## 💡 Optional: Make Paywall Dismissal More Obvious

If you want to make it even clearer for reviewers, you can:

### Option 1: Make "Not Now" Button More Prominent

In `PaywallView.swift`:
```swift
// Make the dismiss button more obvious
Button(action: { onDismiss() }) {
    Text("Try Free Version")
        .font(.headline)
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
}
.padding()
```

### Option 2: Add Skip Button to Onboarding

In `OnboardingFlowView.swift`:
```swift
// Optional: Allow skipping account creation
Button("Continue Without Account") {
    completeOnboarding()
}
.foregroundColor(.white.opacity(0.7))
```

**But these changes are optional!** Your current implementation is fine if users can dismiss the paywall.
